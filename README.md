This mindfulness meditation journal app was designed and coded by Adam Caplan, as part of a project for General Assembly.

This app is designed to provide an easy way for people to journal their experiences meditating, reflect on their experiences, to track changes, and observe progress over time. It is a useful tool for anyone who wants to increase their level of mindfulness!

The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and makes use of the jQuery library, Bootstrap toolkit, AJAX, and JSON.

User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to log in, change my password, and log out.
- As a meditator, I want to be able to enter notes about each of my meditation sessions.
- As a meditator, I want to be able to review past sessions

I began developing the front end of this project by creating sign up, sign in, change password, and logout features, and connected all to the API (https://github.com/apcaplan/mindfulness-journal-api). Then I created features for the user to create, read, update, and delete entries. When all features were fully functional, I began styling and debugging. This process will continue in future versions.

Future versions will also include an about section with information about meditation and how to practice, optional prompts in the notes section (such as "how did the meditation go?" "what obstacles arose in your practice?", "what did you notice in your mind? in your body?", etc.), a countdown timer for practicing along with the app, and a calendar to schedule and track regular practice!
